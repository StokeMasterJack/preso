### Two native apps@ul - Android-native app   - Language: Java or Kotlin   - UI widgets: Android-native widgets - iOS-native app   - Language: Swift or Objective-C   - UI widgets: iOS-native widgets@ulend   :+1      ---### Native UI widgets - Android and iOS both include a set of native UI widgets - Do not ship as part of the app - Must be preinstalled on the device - Part of the device, not part of the app---### Pros - Best performance - Most native look and feel---### Cons - Two platforms to learn - Two code bases to maintain - Cross-platform code sharing: zero - More than two platforms to support   - Multiple versions of iOS   - Multiple versions of Android - Some quotes from developers   - It is hard to make a reliable UI because native Android widgets behave differently across Android versions   - I once lost a whole day fixing a drop-down menu that worked differently on Android 4.1.2.   - Why are there a thousand different versions of every Android package and every single one breaks another?   - there are still a huge chunk of users running Android 4 while others use 5, 6 and there are a ton of breaking changes between each version, and users can't even upgrade their devices---### Two native apps---
